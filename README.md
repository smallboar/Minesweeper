# Basic-Java-Minesweeper
It has very basic graphics and it's not perfect, I used this as my first project to learn graphics in Java.

I was too lazy to add a restart button for the game and an input spot for row/column/mine count,
you can add it if you want

You'll also have to change the assetPath variable to your own files named mine.png and flag.png to play(or I can add that as an argument for GraphicsMain)

It wasn't really written that efficiently, since this was essentially my first project, so there can be a lot of improvements on this, 
but I'll be working on my next project now, I just used this to practice some basic Java skills as well as learn some basic Java graphics.
